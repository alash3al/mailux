MaiLux
=======
Mailux is a microservice designed to recieve mails on temporarily inboxes so the user can send emails from his mail to the temp-email we generated before, so you as a developer can login him without password!

Flow
=====
- You request the `/mailbox/generate/<email@address.here>`.
- The user send an email to the mailbox generated by the above step.
- You hit the `/mailbox/info/<mailboxID>` each X of time (from the browser).
- if the above step returned that it has been received, just send a request to the backend to hit the above endpoint again just as a confirmation, after that you respond to the browser with a `token/session`.

Help
====
```bash
# have fun with this!
$ mailux --help
```
